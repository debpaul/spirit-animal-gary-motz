# Working?
- I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this.

## Coincidence
- My other spirit animal choice was the Owl! I appreciate their disposition. Most times, I would say I'm an owl. But if my daemon is to represent my weaker side, then it must be the rabbit. What other animal might you have chosen?
